# Production

Administration and organisation of development production and production goals.

## What is this repository for?
This repository contains all development production goals for The Mana World. Anything related to content production should be included here.

---

Issues in this repository are always about pieces of content starting in the concept phase. Issues should be labelled and weighted appropriately by those opening them or by those in charge of production.
 An issue is closed when the content discussed is either completed or discarded.

Production milestones are tracked mainly at group level (outwith this repo) so that any relevant issues and MRs can be assigned to them from various repositories.
 Issues in this repo should be assigned to an appropriate milestone either by those opening them or by those in charge of production.

Any documentation related to production, planning and general organisation should be stored in this repository.

## Work in Progress

- World Design: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOh9bBfo=/
